I2C Operation
	Slave Address (0x28 for 7-bit)
		Device can use up to two accelerometers.
		If SAO is connected to ground
			Write = 0x50
			Read = 0x51
		If SAO is connected to voltage	
			Write = 0x52
			Read = 0x53

	Registers
		0x0F = WHO_AM_I 
			Returns 0x33

		0x20 = CTRL_REG1 (Use this to disable/enable any axis or adjust the sample rate)
			Default = 0x07 (unpowered mode)
			Disable an axis in order to have interrupt trip on values below 0.7g.
		0x21 = CTRL_REG2 (Use this to disable/enable high-pass filtering to eliminate offset of acceleration output)
		0x24 = CTRL_REG5 (Use this register to set latch options)
			bit 5 = INT1 latch (default: 0 = unlatched)
			bit 7 = INT2 latch (default: 0 = unlatched)
		0x25 = CTRL_REG6 (Use this register to enable interrupts on pins)
			bit 2 = Interrupt 1 enable (default: 0 = disabled)
			bit 3 = Interrupt 2 enable (default: 0 = disabled)
			bit 4 = Boot on interrupt 2 pin (default: 0 = disabled)
			bit 5 = Sleep/wake on interrupt 2 pin (default: 0 = disabled)
			bit 7 = Interrupt signal toggle (default: 0 = high)

		0x29 OUT_X
			X-axis acceleration data. The value is expressed in two’s complement with 8-bit data representation left-justified. (val / 16000)
		0x2B OUT_Y
			Y-axis acceleration data. The value is expressed in two’s complement with 8-bit data representation left-justified. (val / 16000)
		0x2D OUT_Z
			Z-axis acceleration data. The value is expressed in two’s complement with 8-bit data representation left-justified. (val / 16000)

		0x30 = INT1_CFG (Enable each axis interrupt request)
		0x31 = INT1_SRC (Tracks interrupts by axis)
		0x32 = INT1_THS (Set interrupt threshold) ((val*16/1000)g)
		0x33 = INT1_DURATION (Set duration required to send interrupt) (val*0.1s)

		0x34 = INT2_CFG (Enable each axis interrupt request)
		0x35 = INT2_SRC (Tracks interrupts by axis)
		0x36 = INT2_THS (Set interrupt threshold)
		0x37 = INT2_DURATION (Set duration required to send interrupt)

Questions:
	Do we want the interrupts to latch?
	What values to set as interrupt thresholds? Durations?
